# 📕 Local Library - Django Project

This project is based on the [MDN Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website), guiding you through the creation of a simple but complete local library web application using **Django**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The `local-library` project demonstrates how to build a full-stack web application using Django, a powerful Python-based web framework. The app simulates a library management system, allowing users to view, borrow, and manage books and authors.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🏗️ **Project Scaffolding**  
  Use Django's command-line tools to generate project and app structure.

- ⚙️ **Development Server**  
  Start and stop Django’s built-in development server for testing and debugging.

- 🗃️ **Data Modeling**  
  Define and manage data using Django ORM models for books, authors, genres, etc.

- 🛠️ **Django Admin Panel**  
  Utilize the auto-generated admin interface to manage library content.

- 👁️ **Views & Templates**  
  Create class-based and function-based views to render dynamic HTML pages.

- 🌐 **URL Routing**  
  Map clean URL paths to the appropriate views using Django's `urls.py`.

- 🔐 **Authentication & Sessions**  
  Implement user login, logout, permissions, and session management.

- 📝 **Forms Handling**  
  Build and validate user input forms using Django’s built-in form system.

- ✅ **Unit Testing**  
  Write test cases to ensure your application logic behaves as expected.

- 🛡️ **Security Practices**  
  Apply Django’s built-in protections against CSRF, XSS, and SQL injection.

- 🚢 **Deployment**  
  Prepare and deploy your Django app to a production environment (e.g., Heroku, Railway, or your own server).
